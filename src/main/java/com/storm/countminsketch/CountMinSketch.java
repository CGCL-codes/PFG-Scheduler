/**
 * Count Min sketch is a probabilistic data structure for finding the frequency of events in a
 * stream of data. The data structure accepts two parameters epsilon and delta, epsilon specifies
 * the error in estimation and delta specifies the probability that the estimation is wrong (or the
 * confidence interval). The default values are 1% estimation error (epsilon) and 99% confidence
 * (1 - delta). Tuning these parameters results in increase or decrease in the size of the count
 * min sketch. The constructor also accepts width and depth parameters. The relationship between
 * width and epsilon (error) is width = Math.ceil(Math.exp(1.0)/epsilon). In simpler terms, the
 * lesser the error is, the greater is the width and hence the size of count min sketch.
 * The relationship between delta and depth is depth = Math.ceil(Math.log(1.0/delta)). In simpler
 * terms, the more the depth of the greater is the confidence.
 * The way it works is, if we need to estimate the number of times a certain key is inserted (or appeared in
 * the stream), count min sketch uses pairwise independent hash functions to map the key to
 * different locations in count min sketch and increment the counter.
 * <p/>
 * For example, if width = 10 and depth = 4, lets assume the hashcodes
 * for key "HELLO" using pairwise independent hash functions are 9812121, 6565512, 21312312, 8787008
 * respectively. Then the counter in hashcode % width locations are incremented.
 * <p/>

 * --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
 * <p/>
 * Now for a different key "WORLD", let the hashcodes be 23123123, 45354352, 8567453, 12312312.
 * As we can see below there is a collision for 2nd hashcode

 * <p/>
 * Now, to get the estimated count for key "HELLO", same process is repeated again to find the
 * values in each position and the estimated count will be the minimum of all values (to account for
 * hash collisions).
 * <p/>
 * estimatedCount("HELLO") = min(1, 2, 1, 1)
 * <p/>
 * so even if there are multiple hash collisions, the returned value will be the best estimate
 * (upper bound) for the given key. The actual count can never be greater than this value.
